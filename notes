React can be initialised using CDN (content delivery network)
we are fetching react library from a hosted environment through CDN

search :
    CDN
    crossorigin

most expensive operation is manipulating nodes in DOM
all js libraries are trying to optimise these operations

React.createElement will create an object with props and details about element

root.render will take this object and convert it to element/tag and renders

CDN links should be first before any scripts since it executes in the order

CDN - Content Delivery Network
    > it is in between original server and end user
    > this caches content by minifying it from the original server and make it available across all cdn edge servers which makes faster execution
    > reduces carbon footprint and traffic on original server
    > it manages different versions of cache
    > it is being used in top FAANG MAANG companies for fastest availability and infrastructure

Crossorigin :
    > it is an html attribute
    > it basically allows request resources from another domain
    > Cors - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
    > it is used for sharing securely and to specific domains
    > preventing DDOS attacks

npm doesn't have a full form, there is no abbrevation
it does not stand for node package manager but it manages node packages

react alone does not make it faster but it requires other packages
one of the important package is bundlers
    > webpack
    > vite
    > parcel

-D says we install package as dev dependency

" ^ " this is caret symbol where you see this in dependency versions, it basically updates the minor versions like

2.8.3 can be auto updated to 2.8.4 if there is a release

" ~ " this is tilda symbol similarly we use like caret but the difference is it updates to major versions like

2.8.3 to 3.0.1(latest)

pacakage-lock.json : 
    - this file keeps exact version of the package to avoid local and production difference issues
    - this makes sure to run the same version of packages so to get same output in different environments
    - integrity is a property where it has hash of sha256 about the package which makes it unique

package.json is a configuration

nodemodules :
    - when you install a package it goes to npm and pull all the code related to package along with parcel's dependencies
    - deep nested dependencies ==> transitive dependencies

npm --> just calling/installing the command
npx --> executing the package

Parcel : 
    - Dev Build
    - Local Server
    - HMR = Hot Module Replacement
    - File Watching Algorithm
    - Caching - Faster Builds
    - Image Optimisation
    - Minification
    - Bundling
    - Compress
    - Consistent Hashing
    - Code Splitting
    - Differential Bundling - support older browsers
    - Diagnostic
    - Error Handling
    - HTTPS
    - Tree Shaking Algorithm - remove unused code
    - Different dev and prod bundles

npx parcel index.html --> development
npx parcel build index.html --> production

browserslist -> handles to support specified browser versions


normal script tag :
    - html parsing will go 
    - if script tag is encountered, then holds parsing and fetches script and executes it and then continue with parsing

async script tag :
    - if script tag is encountered, it will not hold parsing and fetches script
    - and then it holds parsing and executes script and then continue with parsing

defer script tag :
    - if script tag is encountered, it will not hold parsing and fetches script
    - after parsing, it will continue with script execution

JSX :
    - jsx is not js+html, it is js+html like syntax
    - it is for developer and reading friendly
    - ES6 and browser does not understand jsx syntax
    - Babel is responsible for for transpiling(converting) jsx to js
    
Babel :
    - it is literally like converts to React.createElement output format where it gives pure js object and can be rendered by ReactDOM
    - it also makes code to support ES5 for older browsers

CSS (cross-site-scripting):
    - when you write js code inside jsx you use {} 
    - JSX takes care of sanitisizing the content rendered inside {} and avoid security issues
    - CSS is having control of js inside the browser to the outside user

Functional Component :
    - it is nothing but a function which returns JSX
    - name should be in Pascal case
    - when rendering a function it should be wrapped with </>(tags)
    - it can also be called as a function but with {} enclosed

React doesn't recommend to use index as keys when rendering list
use unique id's for keys

Import, Export types :
    - default export
    - named export

Reconciliation Algorithm :
    - React Fiber(performs dom optimised manipulation) introduced in React 16
    - Diff Algorithm responsible for finding differences between two virtual doms
    - object representation of elements is virtual dom
    - incremental rendering

github repo : acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

- this process is the React's core feature, it is why react is fast
- whenever there is a change in state or dom this reconciliation process comes into picture
- this will first get the virtual dom of previous version and creates a new virtual dom of current version/state
- then diff algorithm takes these two virtual doms and compare them effectively and find the differences
- now react updates these changes into real dom effectively in optimised way and makes it fast rendering
- when you say virtual dom, it will be in a object format like wjen you console jsx it contains nodes and detailed json structure of props
- but when you say real dom it is the actual html elements
- comparing real doms directly is too costly and slow process that is why react uses virtual doms and makes it faster

virtual dom existed before react, it is not a react thing but react used it effectively

when you update state the setstate function triggers reconciliation process and makes a re-render
